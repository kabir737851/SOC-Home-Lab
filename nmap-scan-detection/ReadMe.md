# Attack Steps: Port Scanning with Nmap (Kali to Metasploitable 3)

## Check Kali Machine's IP Address
1) Open the terminal on your Kali Linux Machine
2) Run the following command to view the current IP address
``` bash
ifconfig
```
3) From the output, I noted the Kali machine's IP as **192.168.177.129**

## Identify Metasploitable 3 Machine's IP Address
1) Next, I switched to the **Metasplotable 3** VM and ran the same command
``` bash
ifconfig
```
2) The IP address for the Metasplotable 3 machine was **192.168.177.130**

## Verify Network Connectivity Between the Machines 
1) Before launching any attacks, I confirmed that both the machines could communicate over the network.
2) From my Kali machine, I ran the command
``` bash
ping 192.168.177.130
```
3) Then, from the Metasploitable3 machine, I tested the reverse connection
``` bash
ping 192.168.177.129
```
4) Both machines successfully responded to each other's ping requests, confirming that they were on the same network and could communicate properly.

## Perform Nmap Port Scan
1) With connectivity confirmed, I initiated a port scan from my Kali machine to the Metasploitable3 target using **nmap**
2) I used the following command to perform a service/version detection scan
``` bash
nmap -sV 192.168.177.130
```
3) This scan helped me identify open ports on the victim machine and provided information about the services running on those ports.

## Analyze Scan Results
1) The scan returned a list of open and closed ports along with the versions of services running on each open port.

2) This marked the completion of the reconnaissance phase.
3) I successfully gathered intelligence about the target systemâ€™s surface area for potential exploitation.

## Logs Forwarding to Splunk & Packet Capture in Wreshark
1) Metasploitable3 was configured to forward logs to Splunk via Syslog, allowing detection of the Nmap scan as a simulated SOC setup. 
2) Additionally, Wireshark was used to capture all network traffic during the event, providing visibility into ICMP pings and the full port scan.
