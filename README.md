# SOC Analyst Virtual Home Lab

## Introduction
I recently built a **virtual home lab** to sharpen my **cybersecurity skills** and **gain hands-on experience** with **attack** and **defence** simulations.
As someone aiming for a role in cybersecurity, I know that just reading about attacks and defences won’t be enough. I need to show practical skills: **launching attacks, analysing logs, monitoring alerts,** and **responding to incidents.**
That’s why I created my own virtual SOC analyst home lab a simulated environment where I can **practice incident detection, log analysis,** and **defensive security techniques using real tools.**
This lab is fully virtualized, cost-effective, and built to mirror real-world security operations on a smaller scale.
